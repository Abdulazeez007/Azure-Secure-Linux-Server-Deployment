# Azure-Secure-Linux-Server-Deployment
Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive, authenticated, browser-accessible terminal for managing Azure resources. It provides the flexibility of choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work, either Bash or PowerShell.

 ## KEY OBJECTIVES
 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Resource Group: This is the foundation for your Azure resources‚Äîlike the sturdy walls of a castle that keep everything inside organized and secure. üè∞

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a VNET (Virtual Network): Think of this as laying down the roads and highways for your data to travel on. It's where your virtual machines will reside and communicate, much like a bustling city. üõ£Ô∏è

3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Azure Bastion: This is your high-security gatekeeper, ensuring that only the right people get through to your virtual machines, much like a bouncer at an exclusive club. üï∂Ô∏è

4Ô∏è‚É£ Create two Ubuntu Virtual Machines: Here, you‚Äôll summon your digital minions‚Äîtwo Ubuntu VMs ready to serve your whims. It‚Äôs like having your own tech-savvy butler duo! ü§ñü§ñ

5Ô∏è‚É£ Connect to the VMs and establish communication using the simple ping command: Time for a friendly chat! With a quick ping, you'll ensure your VMs can talk to each other‚Äîthink of it as sending a text to check if your friend is still awake at 3 AM. üì±üí¨

6Ô∏è‚É£ Clean Up Resources: After all the fun, it‚Äôs time to tidy up! Just like putting away your toys after playtime, you‚Äôll want to ensure everything is cleaned up properly to avoid any lingering costs. üßπ

## STEP 1 Create Azure Resource Group

I used New-AzResourceGroup to create a resource group to host the virtual network and the VMs, to create a resource group named ***Aurora-RG*** in the ***centralus*** Azure region.

## STEP 2: Create Virtual Network
Use New-AzVirtualNetwork to create a virtual network named ***Aurora-Vnet*** with IP address prefix ***10.0.0.0/16*** in the ***Aurora-RG*** resource group and ***centralus*** location

## Next: Create a Subnet 
configured subnet, and associated the subnet configurations to the virtual Network to a subnet within the virtual network. Use Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig to create a subnet configuration named ***Aurora-Subnet*** with address prefix ***10.0.0.0/24***

## STEP 3: Deploy Azure Bastion
Azure Bastion enables secure, browser-based access to virtual machines (VMs) within your virtual network using Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). This solution eliminates the need for VMs to have public IP addresses, client software, or any additional configurations, enhancing security and simplifying management. By leveraging Azure Bastion, cloud engineers can ensure that remote connections are securely facilitated through private IP addresses, reducing the attack surface and adhering to best practices for cloud security.

First, I configured a dedicated Bastion subnet within the virtual network. This subnet is exclusively reserved for Azure Bastion resources and must be named **AzureBastionSubnet** to ensure proper functionality and compliance with Azure requirements.

## Next Create Bastion Public IP

- set up a public IP address for the Bastion host, allowing it to access SSH and RDP over port 443.
- Then Finally, I used the **New-AzBastion** command to create a new Standard SKU Bastion host in ***AzureBastion-Subnet***.

## STEP 4: Create Ubuntu Servers
For the first Server, (Aurora-Server1) Set the administrator and password and provision the virtual Machine;

Use New-AzVM to create two VMs named ***Aurora-Server1*** and ***Aurora-Server2*** in the subnet of the virtual network. When prompted for credentials, enter usernames and passwords for the VMs.

## STEP 5 Lauch Servers and Establish Connection

Next, I connected to my VMs in the Azure Portal using the Bastion host I deployed earlier. This allows for secure RDP (3389) and SSH (22) connections over port 443, eliminating the need for public-facing IP addresses and enhancing the security of our connections. üîí

First Server (**Aurora-Server1**)

    -In the portal, search for and select Virtual machines. üñ•Ô∏è
    -On the Virtual machines page, select Aurora-Server1.
    -In the Overview section for Aurora-Server1, click Connect.
    -On the Connect to virtual machine page, select the Bastion tab.
    -Choose Use Bastion.
    -Enter the username and password you created for the Aurora-Server1, then click Connect. üöÄ
